# pages
Pages are a static Post Type, outside of the normal blog stream/feed. Their features are:

- non-time dependent and without a time stamp
- are not organized using the categories and/or tags taxonomies
- can have page templates applied to them
- can be organized in a hierarchical structure â€” i.e. pages can be parents/children of other pages
 
The template files that display the Page post type are:

1. page.php and all its iterations
2. $custom.php and all its iterations
3. front-page.php
4. search.php
5. index.php
